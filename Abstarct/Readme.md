# Abstract

This projects aims to develop design automation in product development. Design automation 
causes increase in producibility and decrease in product cost and manufacturing lead time. 
The study at hand is proposed to provide a new method and to introduce procedure to the design 
of wiring pattern for a car seat heater for Kongsberg Automotive, KA. KA is a Norwegian 
company and a global provider of engineering, design, and manufacture for seat comfort, driver 
and motion control systems, fluid assemblies, and industrial driver interface products. The method 
that currently is used in the company to create a wiring pattern is neither sufficient enough nor 
automated. 

In order to design the wiring pattern, at first procedure is handled by the designer. Secondly, car 
seat heater 2D layout is imported and then, the dimensions of the elements are defined as 
constraints. Then VBA codes are opened and the program is run. The result will be a wiring 
pattern in different 2D layouts. To make the design process easier, we have modeled five different 
layouts; wiring pattern of one element, two elements, three elements, five elements (with two back 
sides) and one element trapezoidal 2D layout. 

The algorithm written in VBA (Visual basic for application) creates the pattern according to the 
dimensions of the elements which are used as inputs to define constrained parameters. The created 
macros are simple to use and easy to modify, independent from the programming knowledge. The 
user is only responsible with parameter input and running the program. The solution gives wiring 
pattern for a car seat heater.
