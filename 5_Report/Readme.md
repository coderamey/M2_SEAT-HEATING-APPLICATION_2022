# Abstract
This projects aims to develop design automation in product development. Design automation causes increase in producibility and decrease in product cost and manufacturing lead time. The study at hand is proposed to provide a new method and to introduce procedure to the design of wiring pattern for a car seat heater for Kongsberg Automotive, KA. KA is a Norwegian company and a global provider of engineering, design, and manufacture for seat comfort, driver and motion control systems, fluid assemblies, and industrial driver interface products. The method that currently is used in the company to create a wiring pattern is neither sufficient enough nor automated.

In order to design the wiring pattern, at first procedure is handled by the designer. Secondly, car seat heater 2D layout is imported and then, the dimensions of the elements are defined as constraints. Then VBA codes are opened and the program is run. The result will be a wiring pattern in different 2D layouts. To make the design process easier, we have modeled five different layouts; wiring pattern of one element, two elements, three elements, five elements (with two back sides) and one element trapezoidal 2D layout.

The algorithm written in VBA (Visual basic for application) creates the pattern according to the dimensions of the elements which are used as inputs to define constrained parameters. The created macros are simple to use and easy to modify, independent from the programming knowledge. The user is only responsible with parameter input and running the program. The solution gives wiring pattern for a car seat heater.

# Objective of the project
The whole project, which is being held in the School of Engineering in co-operation with the KA, includes the entire process required to create a quotation for a car seat-heater. This research attempts to develop a design automation method supporting automated systems for product design, process planning and cost estimation (Elgh and Cederfeldt 2005).Once the geometry is created by the company, the requirements for quotation process such as wiring pattern, wire type and length, material data and cost estimation etc. are met by the project itself. The aim of this thesis is to create an algorithm for the wiring pattern of the car seat-heater. Combined with the ongoing research project in School of Engineering, this study will reduce the manual and time-consuming work held in the company. Moreover, the solution will result in shortening the quotation lead-time and prevent hand-made mistakes by means of an optimized pattern. This work will be performed in CATIA V5 via using the Visual Basic macros to create a generative design. The algorithm will only be parametrically dependent to the shape and size of the seat. Since the solution is obtained by the algorithm itself, the user dependency is limited only with parameter 4 inputs which define the 2D outline of the heater. By this way, the necessity to the program knowledge is disabled.
