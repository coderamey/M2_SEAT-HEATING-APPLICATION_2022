# Introduction

In today’s world almost all of the large scaled companies are holding only the assembly lines in 
their own plants and most of the production and manufacturing facilities are provided by the SMEs 
(small and medium sized enterprise). In order to compute within each other, subcontractors have to 
show on-time response in quotations with high accuracy in delivery and cost estimations to be able 
to do such co-operations with the large-scaled companies.
  The project is involved with the estimation of wiring pattern, wire properties, manufacturing data 
and the manufacturing costs of a new product. The wiring pattern of the system is provided with an 
algorithm. 
The objective with this project is either to explore new approaches or improve already existing 
algorithm for wiring pattern of the car seat heaters which is not sufficient enough.

## Objective of the project
The whole project, which is being held in the School of Engineering in co-operation with the KA, 
includes the entire process required to create a quotation for a car seat-heater. This research 
attempts to develop a design automation method supporting automated systems for product design, 
process planning and cost estimation (Elgh and Cederfeldt 2005).Once the geometry is created by 
the company, the requirements for quotation process such as wiring pattern, wire type and length, 
material data and cost estimation etc. are met by the project itself. 
The aim of this thesis is to create an algorithm for the wiring pattern of the car seat-heater. 
Combined with the ongoing research project in School of Engineering, this study will reduce the 
manual and time-consuming work held in the company. Moreover, the solution will result in 
shortening the quotation lead-time and prevent hand-made mistakes by means of an optimized 
pattern. This work will be performed in CATIA V5 via using the Visual Basic macros to create a generative 
design. The algorithm will only be parametrically dependent to the shape and size of the seat. Since 
the solution is obtained by the algorithm itself, the user dependency is limited only with parameter 
4 inputs which define the 2D outline of the heater. By this way, the necessity to the program 
knowledge is disabled.

##  Design and process
Design knowledge has been adapted to human’s society when they accepted the products with 
multifunctional acts in their life. By growing of modern societies, engineering design becomes more 
dominant in lives. Thus, design engineers make designs more applicable. The design engineer 
performed both engineering and low level management work and was in a position to gain 
familiarity with the organization and the key people. (Ertas.A and Jones.J.C 1996) 
Design concept is the new systematic frame of the knowledge to solve the variety of requirements 
by creating the solution in assist of design, manufacturing and assembling. The design process 
begins with an identified need and concludes with satisfactory qualification and acceptance testing 
of the prototype (Ertas.A and Jones.J.C 1996). In order to achieve the computable products price in 
the market and to satisfy the customer specifications. Most companies are interested and adapted
design engineers to order for their profitability and to be able to respond quickly with competitive 
prices and a short product delivery time (Elgh 2007). 
In the competitive product environment, cost and manufacturing lead time with respect to customer 
requirements are the main basic constrains that have to be reduced in production process. It is 
required to find the new systematic way that has confirmed in the product development to achieve 
this goal. 
The cost in different steps of processes such as design, manufacturing process is relevant. More 
efforts on design approach are to decrease the manufacturing cost and desirable final product by 
considering the resource limitation in market.

## Design automation
Design automation reduce the important feature cost, lead time, and manage the large amount of 
information by using tools, and organized concept simultaneously. Using CAD/CAM tools has lots 
of efficient to achieve the goals. Other advantages are succeeding in: 

• Reduce design life cycle that makes products serviceable to other purposes. 

• Choice of the design, manufacturing process of product is improved. 

• Cut the number of testing down to increase the accuracy. 

• Making the congenial of the design specification and customer requirements. 

• Providing easy feedback to meet manufacturing ability limitation. 

• Simplifying the modification on the product design from the feedback requirements. 

• To understand the new methods by accomplish and use of computer’s programming and 
CAD software to improve producibility.
