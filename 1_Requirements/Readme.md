# Introduction

In todayâ€™s world almost all of the large scaled companies are holding only the assembly lines in 
their own plants and most of the production and manufacturing facilities are provided by the SMEs 
(small and medium sized enterprise). In order to compute within each other, subcontractors have to 
show on-time response in quotations with high accuracy in delivery and cost estimations to be able 
to do such co-operations with the large-scaled companies.
  The project is involved with the estimation of wiring pattern, wire properties, manufacturing data 
and the manufacturing costs of a new product. The wiring pattern of the system is provided with an 
algorithm. 
The objective with this project is either to explore new approaches or improve already existing 
algorithm for wiring pattern of the car seat heaters which is not sufficient enough.
