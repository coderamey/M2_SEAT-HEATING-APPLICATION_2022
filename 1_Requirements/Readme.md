# Introduction

In todayâ€™s world almost all of the large scaled companies are holding only the assembly lines in 
their own plants and most of the production and manufacturing facilities are provided by the SMEs 
(small and medium sized enterprise). In order to compute within each other, subcontractors have to 
show on-time response in quotations with high accuracy in delivery and cost estimations to be able 
to do such co-operations with the large-scaled companies.
  The project is involved with the estimation of wiring pattern, wire properties, manufacturing data 
and the manufacturing costs of a new product. The wiring pattern of the system is provided with an 
algorithm. 
The objective with this project is either to explore new approaches or improve already existing 
algorithm for wiring pattern of the car seat heaters which is not sufficient enough.

## Objective of the project
The whole project, which is being held in the School of Engineering in co-operation with the KA, 
includes the entire process required to create a quotation for a car seat-heater. This research 
attempts to develop a design automation method supporting automated systems for product design, 
process planning and cost estimation (Elgh and Cederfeldt 2005).Once the geometry is created by 
the company, the requirements for quotation process such as wiring pattern, wire type and length, 
material data and cost estimation etc. are met by the project itself. 
The aim of this thesis is to create an algorithm for the wiring pattern of the car seat-heater. 
Combined with the ongoing research project in School of Engineering, this study will reduce the 
manual and time-consuming work held in the company. Moreover, the solution will result in 
shortening the quotation lead-time and prevent hand-made mistakes by means of an optimized 
pattern. This work will be performed in CATIA V5 via using the Visual Basic macros to create a generative 
design. The algorithm will only be parametrically dependent to the shape and size of the seat. Since 
the solution is obtained by the algorithm itself, the user dependency is limited only with parameter 
4 inputs which define the 2D outline of the heater. By this way, the necessity to the program 
knowledge is disabled.
